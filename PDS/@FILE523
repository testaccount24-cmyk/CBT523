//*       This program will read SMF data (from the MAN             *   FILE 523
//*      datasets or output from IFASMFDP), and will select         *   FILE 523
//*      records according to user specified criteria.              *   FILE 523
//*      Records can be selected by date and time, by record        *   FILE 523
//*      type (and /or subtype), by Jobname, or by data at an       *   FILE 523
//*      offset within the record. Records must meet date/time      *   FILE 523
//*      and record type criteria before being eligible for         *   FILE 523
//*      selection, as determined by Jobname and/or data            *   FILE 523
//*      specifications.                                            *   FILE 523

//*       By default, any records selected from the input           *   FILE 523
//*      will be printed to SYSPRINT, unless 'PRINT=NO' is          *   FILE 523
