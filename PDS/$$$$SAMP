   The following are samples of the JCL and Control Cards used to
  execute SMFSLCT, and a brief explanation of the effects of
  the various control cards.

       SMFSLCT will read the active SMF datasets, and select the 1st

       Dump format (hex and EBCDIC) on SYSPRINT.

       Monday and Friday of the previous week. Selected records will be
       copied to SYSUT2, which will have the same DCB attributes as
       SYSUT1 (since none were specified). The selected records will

       SMFSLCT will ignore any input records produced before
       00:00:00 on 87.015, and terminate after finding a record
       produced after 17:00:00 on 87.017.
       For the output file specified by DDName OUT1:
        Record types 5, 20, and 30 subtype 2, for Jobs with the
        name "JOBONE" will be selected, but not printed.
       For the output file specified by DDName OUT2:
        Record type 34 for Jobs (TSO users) with the names "TSO1"
        or "TSO2" will be selected, and printed.
        The global date-time specification is overridden for this
        output file only.
       For the output file specified by DDName OUT3:
        All records containing the character string "A B C" in
        positions 257-261 (relative to 0, including the RDW) will
        be selected and printed. The exit "EXIT5" will be invoked
        for each record selected for "OUT3"
