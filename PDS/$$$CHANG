      1999/04/24 SDDA030 V1.1
                 Added code to ignore records invalidly spanned
                 in non-VSAM VBS input.
                 Calculated DCB=NCP (BSAM), DCB=BUFNO (QSAM), or
                 AMP=BUFSP (VSAM) so we can read a cylinder of
                 input at a time (if input on DASD).
                 Used MACRF=PM on output file(s), so VBS datasets
                 can be created.
                 Lives and executes in 31-bit mode.
                 Used internal LIFO stack for dynamic storage
                 Made Y2K compliant!
      1999/07/22 SDDA030 V1.2
                 Added Date conversion routines.
                 Added new START=/END= date keywords.
                 Added 24-bit EODAD for SYSIN, if required
      1999/11/18 SDDA030 V1.3
                 Moved SYSUT1 OPEN logic(?) to its own subroutine
                 (I0010)
                 Added comments

      2002/02/07 SDDA030 V1.4
                 Added stack below the line.
                 Added new parms for exits as suggested by Dave
                 Alcock.
                 Added parms to INEXIT=/OUTEXIT= statements.
                 Defaulted 2-digit years on START=/END= to the
                 current century.
                 Corrected S0C4 Abends when lots of record types
                 or jobnames selected (Thanks to Paul
                 Luttenberger).
                 Changed RDJFCBs to SWAREQs.
                 Corrected logic when setting DCB characteristics
                 for new output datasets with no DCB spacified.
                 Printed **VIO** for volser when appropriate.
      2006/10/26 SDDA030 V1.5
                 Fixed bug when printing record subtypes to be
                 selected (thanks to BBordonaro).
                 Corrected calculation of SYSPRINT LRECL (fixed
                 check for CC) (thanks to Martin Samson).
                 Corrected non-re-entrancy error with SYSUT1 EXLST
                 (thanks to Martin Samson - again!).

      2013-03-19 RWSUHR  V1.6
                 Set return code to 8 if nothing is selected

      2015-11-13 RWSUHR  V1.72 - @RWS
                 Fixed an S0C7, when OUTPUT= was specified
                 added assembly date and time and change person
                 ID (ID of person who last changed this program)
